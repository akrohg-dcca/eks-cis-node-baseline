    SSH to the worker nodes

    To check to see if the Kubelet Service is running:
    ```
    sudo systemctl status kubelet
    ```
    The output should return `Active: active (running) since..`

    Run the following command on each node to find the appropriate kubeconfig
file:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```
    The output of the above command should return something similar to
`--kubeconfig /var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig` which is the location of the
kubeconfig file.

    Run this command to obtain the kubeconfig file ownership:

    ```
    stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig
    ```

    The output of the above command gives you the kubeconfig file's ownership.
Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
each worker node. For example,

    ```
    chown root:root <proxy kubeconfig file>
