# eks-cis-node-baseline (WIP)

Work-in-progress InSpec profile to validate the secure configuration of AWS EKS, against [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/)'s CIS Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Benchmark version 1.0.1.

## Getting Started

This profile should be executed from a runner host against each node comprising an EKS cluster in AWS using SSH. EKS nodes must be configured to accept an SSH connection from the runner host.

The profile may be downloaded to the runner for execution, or simply executed directly off of this GitHub repository. InSpec profiles can use different reporters to pressent output, such as the `cli` reporter to print results to the terminal and the `json` reporter to generate a JSON file of the results.

Executing the profile by downloading it to the runner:

```
git clone https://github.com/mitre/eks-cis-node-baseline.git
cd eks-cis-node-baseline
inspec exec . -t ssh://ec2-user@<node 1 IP address> -i private_key.pem --reporter cli json:node1results.json
...
inspec exec . -t ssh://ec2-user@<node N IP address> -i private_key.pem --reporter cli json:nodeNresults.json
```

Executing the profile by executing it from this GitHub repository:

```
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/eks-cis-node-baseline.git -t ssh://ec2-user@<node 1 IP address> -i private_key.pem --reporter cli json:node1results.json
...
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/eks-cis-node-baseline.git -t ssh://ec2-user@<node N IP address> -i private_key.pem --reporter cli json:nodeNresults.json
```

**For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.**

Latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.
